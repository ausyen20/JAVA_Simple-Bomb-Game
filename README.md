# JAVA_Simple-Bomb-Game
In this project, I used recursion to find out potential bombs located in adjacent squares. User will click on a square, if there are bombs nearby, therefore, it should check the all adjacent squares for bombs and display counts. If not, it will remain empty square. Program will be terminated when the user clicked on a bomb.
