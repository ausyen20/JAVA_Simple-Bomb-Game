# JAVA_Simple-Bomb-Game
In this project, I used recursion to find out potential bombs located in adjacent squares.
User will click on a square, if there are bombs nearby, therefore, it should check the all adjacent squares for bombs and display counts. 
If not, it will remain empty square. User can right click on a square to place a flag, therefore, the square can not be clicked until removal (right clicked again)
Program will be terminated when the user clicked on a bomb. It will display a message for lose notification.
